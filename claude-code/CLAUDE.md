# Writing code

- We prefer simple, clean, maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones, even if the latter are more concise or performant. Readability and maintainability are primary concerns.
- Make the smallest reasonable changes to get to the desired outcome. You MUST ask permission before reimplementing features or systems from scratch instead of updating the existing implementation.
- When modifying code, match the style and formatting of surrounding code, even if it differs from standard style guides. Consistency within a file is more important than strict adherence to external standards.
- NEVER make code changes that aren't directly related to the task you're currently assigned. If you notice something that should be fixed but is unrelated to your current task, document it in a new issue instead of fixing it immediately.
- NEVER remove code comments unless you can prove that they are actively false. Comments are important documentation and should be preserved even if they seem redundant or unnecessary to you.
- All code files should start with a brief 2 line comment explaining what the file does. Each line of the comment should start with the string "ABOUTME: " to make it easy to grep for.
- When writing comments, avoid referring to temporal context about refactors or recent changes. Comments should be evergreen and describe the code as it is, not how it evolved or was recently changed.
- NEVER implement a mock mode for testing or for any purpose. We always use real data and real APIs, never mock implementations.
- NEVER name things as 'improved' or 'new' or 'enhanced', etc. Code naming should be evergreen. What is new someday will be "old" someday.

# Getting help

- ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.
- If you're having trouble with something, it's ok to stop and ask for help. Especially if it's something your human might be better at.

# Testing

- Tests MUST cover the functionality being implemented.
- NEVER ignore the output of the system or the tests - Logs and messages often contain CRITICAL information.
- TEST OUTPUT MUST BE PRISTINE TO PASS
- If the logs are supposed to contain errors, capture and test it.

## We practice TDD. That means:

- Write tests before writing the implementation code
- Implementations should pass all tests
- Refactor code continuously while ensuring tests still pass

### TDD Implementation Process

- Write a failing test that defines a desired function or improvement
- Run the test to confirm it fails as expected
- Write minimal code to make the test pass
- Run the test to confirm success
- Refactor code to improve design while keeping tests green
- Repeat the cycle for each new feature or bugfix

# Specific Technologies

- When using Python always follow best practices in: @~/.claude/docs/python.md
- When using UV (Python dependency management tool) always follow best practices in: @~/.claude/docs/using-uv.md
- When using Docker with UV (Docker + Python dependency management tool) always follow best practices in: @~/.claude/docs/docker-uv.md

# Learning-Focused Error Response

When encountering tool failures (biome, ruff, pytest, etc.):

- Treat each failure as a learning opportunity, not an obstacle
- Research the specific error before attempting fixes
- Explain what you learned about the tool/codebase
- Build competence with development tools rather than avoiding them

Remember: Quality tools are guardrails that help you, not barriers that block you.

# Other things

- When searching or modifying code, you must use ast-grep (sg). Do not use grep, ripgrep, ag, sed, or regex-only tools.
  ast-grep is required because it matches against the abstract syntax tree (AST) and allows safe, language-aware queries and rewrites.
- Always prefer sg for code analysis, queries, or refactoring tasks.
- NEVER disable functionality instead of fixing the root cause problem
- NEVER create duplicate templates/files to work around issues - fix the original
- NEVER claim something is "working" when functionality is disabled or broken
- ALWAYS identify and fix the root cause of template/compilation errors
- ALWAYS use one shared template instead of maintaining duplicates
- WHEN facing template issues, debug the actual problem rather than creating workarounds

Problem-Solving Approach:

- FIX problems, don't work around them
- MAINTAIN code quality and avoid technical debt
- USE proper debugging to find root causes
- AVOID shortcuts that break user experience
