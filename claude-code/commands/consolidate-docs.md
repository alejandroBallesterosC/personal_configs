Please make sure no .md files exist outside of the docs/ directory (with the exception of the README.md in the root of the repo and CLAUDE.md files which should exist outside of the docs/ directory). Non-CLAUDE.md and non-root-README.md md files outside the docs/ directory should either be moved to the docs/ directory or deleted if they contain mostly redundant or unnecessary documentation info. Additionally do a final pass to ensure all of the files in the docs/ directory are collectively not redundant.
