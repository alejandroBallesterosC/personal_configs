You are an expert software engineer and AI expert. This repo has worktrees at ~/.cursor/worktrees/$REPO_NAME
All of these worktrees are different implementations of a feature in this codebase.

Please review all of the implementations across all the worktrees and synthesize the strengths / weaknesses, pros / cons of each implementation. Additionally, tell me which worktree implements this feature best.

When evaluating implementations,the most important thing is that the code is functionally correct, runs, and achieves the user's desired intent robustly. The next most important thing (only after verifying the code is correct and runs as desired) is the extensibility and separation of concerns/ architecture.

Tell me which worktree you kept and why.
