Now that you have planned the approach, please split the planned approach into manageable pieces that can be executed independently in parallel. Then, create custom claude code subagents (project-level) in this repo (.claude/agents/) to work on this plan in parallel such that each subagent is prompted and designed to execute an independent component of the plan. Please read the documentation for subagents in the claude code documentation on Anthropic's website so you are familiar with how to define them and the best practices for using them well before you define them. Each subagent should maintain it's own list of TODOs and update their corresponding list as they make progress. Additionally, all subagents should share context so they can understand the high-level goals and abide by contractual interfaces between their work when working on interconnected parts of the codebase. Then prepare to spawn the custom sub agents to execute the plan upon user approval.

IMPORTANT: Please report back how you split the components of our plan into independent pieces, how many agents you will spawn, and how they will work together, and ensure I approve this before starting the work.
