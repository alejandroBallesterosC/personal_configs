# Goal
Update the CLAUDE.md files and all relevant docmentation (.md) files in this repo so they accurately reflect the current state of the repo/codebase. The CLAUDE.md files should help claude code work effectively in the repo, while other markdown documentation files should help new people to the repo effectively work in it.

# Instructions
Do this by first reviewing the progress we have made, then review the current state of the entire codebase very thoroughly, then thoroughly review all documentation files (.md) in this repo, next ensure these documentation files are all up to date with our current progress and state of the codebase by updating them while adhering to the specified requirements below. Finally, review the CLAUDE.md files throughout this repo and update them according to the specified requirements below.

# Requirements
- Do not write TODOs or elaborate potential improvements in any CLAUDE.md or other documentation file that I have not explicitly asked for, if you want to note suggested improvements or things to think about long term you can do that in a very concise section at a high level.
- Do not use Emojis.
- If a central README.md does not exist in the root of this repo please create one. If a CLAUDE.md does not exist in the root of this repo please create one.

## Documentation Specific Requirements
- The documentation should help someone new to the repo understand it and self-serve easily, keep only information that does this and do not be overly verbose. The docs should be concise while still going into enough detail to be helpful for people to self-serve.
- Remove stale information that is no longer accurate or in sync with the current state of the codebase.
- Ensure all of the documentation files (.md) are linked and explained at the beginning of the main/central README.md in the root of the repo

## CLAUDE.md Specific Requirements
- Follow the `writing-claude-md` skill from the `claude-md-best-practices` plugin for CLAUDE.md best practices
- Ensure CLAUDE.md files are in sync with READMEs and other documentation
- Prune outdated or redundant items
- Use `@path/to/file` imports to reference existing documentation instead of duplicating content
