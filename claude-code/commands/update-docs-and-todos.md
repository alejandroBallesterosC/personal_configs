# Goal
Update the relevant todos in CLAUDE.md, any other relevant areas of CLAUDE.md, and all relevant docmentation (.md) files in this repo

# Instructions
Do this by first reviewing the progress we have made and the current state of the entire codebase very thoroughly, then review all documentation files (.md) in this repo and ensure they are all up to date with our current progress and state of the codebase. Additionally, ensure all of the documentation files (.md) are linked and explained at the beginning of the main/central README.md in the root of the repo.

# Requirements
- Do not write TODOs or elaborate potential improvements in the CLAUDE.md or any other documentation file that I have not explicitly asked for, if you want to note suggested improvements or things to think about long term you can do that in a very concise section at a high level.
- The documentation should help someone new to the repo understand it and self-serve easily, keep only information that does this and do not be overly verbose. The docs should be concise while still going into enough detail to be helpful for people to self-serve.
- Only use emojis sparingly.
- If a central README.md does not exist in the root of this repo please create one. If a CLAUDE.md does not exist in the root of this repo please create one.
